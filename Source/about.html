          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I was working in the Wine Industry prior to joining the fun of coding.
            I have worked 11 years in that profession.It was time for a change. I
            was looking for a career change but the 'million dollar question' was
            "What?". Then someone suggested if I would like to try to do coding.

        <h2>Coding Journey</h2>
        <!-- <img id="coding" src="/Images/coding-vs-programming-2.jpg" alt=""> -->
        <p>
          My journey with coding started with a call to one of the teachers at
          Coder Academy. I was asked to try some coding exercises and see how I
          feel About it. That's where I felt a belonging to a career. <br />

          After trying coding, I signed up with Coder Academy. A best decision
          that has given me a different perspective of a career. People are very
          friendly in this industry are so approachable and helpful.
